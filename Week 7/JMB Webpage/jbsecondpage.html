    <p class="content">Jared McCann Benge is a composer, sound artist, guitarist, bassist, vocalist, sound engineer, and producer.
    Growing up in Billings, MT, Jared began playing music from an early age where he studied the guitar and bass with Elizabeth Adcock and Parker Brown.
    Benge also sang as a member of the Billings, MT Boys Honor Choir under the direction of Tony Hammond and the Billings Senior High Varsitiy Singers under the direction of Darren Small.
    Inspired to create music on his own terms, Benge founded the short lived punk rock band SENSORY! in 2014.
    Shortly after recording a five song EP, members Wyatt and Jared Farnsworth's relocated to Spokane, WA thus ending SENSORY!'s prolific journey as a band.
    Following the breakup of SENSORY!, Benge formed the psych punk band Snow Bored in 2015 with bassist Carsten Wright and drummer Hayden Duncan.
    The trio would go on to play numerous DIY house shows, record two albums and one live EP before their untimely demise in 2018. 
    Benge also played lead guitar for the rock band JEMS and drums for the shoegaze band Golden Hour.
    Jared moved to Missoula, MT in 2017 to pursue music composition while performing as a bassist in the UM Symphony Orchestra and a guitarist in the UM Jazz Combos and Guitar Ensemble.
    Now in his fourth year of his composition studies, Jared has begun a BA in Media Arts where he specializes in sound and film studies.
    Jared's work emphasizes the use of modular Eurorack systems, effects pedals, visual reactive music, non-notated music, and rock music for chamber settings.</p>
